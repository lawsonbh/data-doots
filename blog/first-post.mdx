Here is my commitment to myself and any readers that come across this blog. I'll write my posts with the following goals:

1. To create a record of my growth over time
2. To share lessons I learn
3. To develop my writing voice

Generally, my writing here will focus on my professional development. In particular, my plan right now is to share technical content as well as general thoughts on the technology industry. Don't be surprised if I sprinkle a few Star Wars references or drop the occasional Lord of the Rings metaphor.

Thank you for reading! I look forward to our shared journey no matter what point you join me at.
